Very small AI Model that Makes your prompts better for AI

Model Used: https://huggingface.co/roborovski/superprompt-v1

Check the model blog here: https://brianfitzgerald.xyz/prompt-augmentation/

## Examples
### 1
This tool has been also used by a **Stable Diffusion 3 Beta Tester** and it shows how good it is and will be when everyone has access to SD 3: https://twitter.com/dark_sm1/status/1774054069126009032
### 2
**Your Prompt** (task prefix already setted): A storefront with 'Text to Image' written on it.

**Generated Better Prompt:** The neon sign above the storefront reads "NeurIPS" in bold, white letters. The storefront is surrounded by a bustling cityscape, with skyscrapers and neon signs lining the walls. The sign is surrounded by a variety of colorful goods, including a variety of fruits, vegetables, and fruits, all arranged in a neat and organized manner. The storefront is surrounded by a bustling crowd of people, all chatting and laughing as they go about their daily routines.

## Local Usage

### Python Code

```py
pip install transformers
```
if its your first time installing the package transformers on Windows, then you may wanna check this https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=powershell#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later.
```py
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("roborovski/superprompt-v1", device_map="auto")

input_text = "Expand the following prompt to add more detail: A storefront with 'Text to Image' written on it."
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")

outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=77)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))

# The neon sign above the storefront reads "NeurIPS" in bold, white letters. The storefront is surrounded by a bustling cityscape, with skyscrapers and neon signs lining the walls. The sign is surrounded by a variety of colorful goods, including a variety of fruits, vegetables, and fruits, all arranged in a neat and organized manner. The storefront is surrounded by a bustling crowd of people, all chatting and laughing as they go about their daily routines.

### Precompiled
As its a very small model (77M parameters) it can run easily and fast even on old PCs CPU:

#### INSTALLATION
1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if you haven't already.
2. Click on Code and download as a zip.
3. Extract it.
4. Open the install_and_run_no_ui.bat if you want to use it without ui, or install_and_run_gradio_ui.bat to use the Gradio UI (if its your first time installing the package transformers on Windows, then you may wanna check this https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=powershell#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later).
5. (UI VERSION ONLY): Ctrl+Click the Local URL link that will appear after installing (DO NOT CLOSE THE CMD UNTIL YOU'RE DONE).
6. After it installs everything, look at ##PARAMETERS for how to use them.
7. After you will get the generated better prompt and it will start all again.
8. If you want to delete it, delete the venvs folder and then put to the trash bin the .zip and folders of the SuperPrompt-v1.

## PARAMETERS
- **Your Prompt:** The prompt you want to make better.
- **Task Prefix:** which is The prompt prefix for how the AI should make yours better, recommended "Expand the following prompt to add more detail"
- **Max New Tokens:** controls how long is the output, reccomended to the max which is 512.
- **Repetition Penalty:** the higher the less the ai repeats itself, it goes from 1.0 to 2.0, 0.7 is suggested.
- **Temperature:** Higher values produce more diverse outputs, it goes from 0 to 1, 0.5 is suggested.
- **Top P:** Higher values sample more low-probability tokens, varies from 0 to 2, 1 is suggested.
- **Top K:** Higher k means more diverse outputs by considering a range of tokens, from 1 to 100, 50 is suggested.
- **Seed:** A starting point to initiate the generation process, any integers, put 0 if you want it to be random.
