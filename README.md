2. extract it and the SuperPrompt-v1.zip inside of it.
3. Open the install_and_run.bat file.
4. After it downloads everything it will ask you for the prompt you want to make better, and also the repetition penalty, the higher the less the ai repeats itself (it goes from 1.0 to 2.0).
5. After you will get the generated better prompt and it will start all again
6. If you want to delete it, open delete.bat and then put to the trash bin the .zip and folders of the SuperPrompt-v1
